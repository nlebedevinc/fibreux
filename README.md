# fibreux

Fibreux is a tidy timetracking UI&UX based on [Fibery](https://fibery.io/) API and service platform.

## Purpose
Fibery provides a few options for a certain consumer to automate daily processes and simply tracking, reporting and visibility. Fibery comes with it's own UI built with React, which is good. However, UI is not usable and not user friendly.

## Prerequisites

You will need:

- `node` (see `.nvmrc` file. You can
  use [`nvm`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to manage versions)

You might also want to install:

- [`docker`](https://www.docker.com/community-edition) with version
  at least `18.02` if you really want to develop inside `docker` containers

## Development

When developing locally, we use:

- [`editorconfig`](http://editorconfig.org/) plugin (**required**)
- [`vscode`](https://code.visualstudio.com/) editor (optional)

## Documentation

Full documentation is available here: [`docs/`](docs).
